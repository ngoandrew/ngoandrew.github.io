## [Programming](https://github.com/ngoandrew)
My personal philosophy when it comes to programming can be succintly described using a lyric from one of the greatest lyrical geniuses of our time, ~~Grimes~~ Charli XCX:
> Vroom vroom

The first line of code I ever learned was:
```
  System.out.println("Hello world!");
```
The languages I know best are:
